applications like stablecoins are some of the most valuable
innovations to come out of DeFi so far. They allow anyone
in the world to benefit from the censorship resistance,
self-­sovereignty, and instant global accessibility of crypto-
currency while having the purchasing power stability of the
dollar—­or, if the dollar ever stops being stable, they enable
people to quickly move their funds into another asset that
does a better job of maintaining stability.


Decentralized finance offers new opportunities. The technology is nascent, but the upside is potentially transformational.
