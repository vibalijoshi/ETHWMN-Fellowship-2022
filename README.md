ETHWMN Fellowship by Devfolio

The ETHWMN Fellowship is an 8-week mentor-led program, exclusive for women, to upskill Web2 developers and enable them to make the transition to Web3 using Ethereum while providing a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem.

Out of 3000 applications received, 120 applicants were invited for interviews and finally 20 fellows were shortlisted for the program. Each fellow would receive a stipend of 1000 USD after completion of all the milestones. 

This repository documents my progress and learnings gained from the weekly assignments and discussions with fellow mentees.
