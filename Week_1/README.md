# Week - 1: Interacting With a Node
## Background
I had no prior knowledge about Ethereum Blockchain, so I educated myself by reading docs and well-known articles from all over the internet. I was really overwhelmed by the first week's assignment when I read it. So I focused all of my efforts on figuring out exactly what the assignment requires. [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) and [Ethereum Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ethereum-cookbook/9781789133998/) were two books that I used as references. All of these enabled me to create a picture of the Ethereum ecosystem. I will soon publish an article about it!

## What I learnt
1. What is Ethereum, Ether and how the blockchain functions.
2. What are nodes?
3. What is an Ethereum client?
4. What are testnets?
5. Explored Geth (Ethereum Client) and Goerli (testnet) in detail.
6. Accounts, Externally Owned Accounts and Smart Contracts and the difference.
7. What is a block? How it is structured?
8. How transactions take place in Ethereum?
9. Made myself familiar with the web3js library. 

## Where I got stuck
1. It took some time to paint a picture and get some realisation of what is happening.
2. The geth node was taking a lot of time to sync so had to find other ways to sync a node ( used Infura )
3. Figuring out how to work around the web3js library. Prior to this I had never referrenced to documents much. 
4. Implementing the code for the first block having a smart contract transaction. After a lot of reading and debugging was able to figure it out.
