# Week - 1: Interacting With a Node
## Background
I did not know anything about Ethereum Blockchain before so I made myself understand about it by reading docs and various famous articles from all over the net. Reading the first wek assignemnt I was quite overwhelmed by it. So I put all my energy into undertstanding what actually the assignment demands. I referenced two books - Mastering Ethereum and Ethereum Cookbook. This all helped me paint a picture about the Ethereum ecosystem.
## What I learnt
1. What is Ethereum, Ether and how the blockchain functions.
2. What are nodes?
3. What is a Ethereum client?
4. What are testnets?
5. Explored Geth (Ethereum Client) and Goerli (testnet) in detail.
6. Accounts, Externally Owned Accounts and Smart Contracts and the difference.
7. What is a block? How it is structured?
8. How transactions take place in Ethereum?
9. Made myself familiar with the web3js library. 

## Where I got stuck
1. It took some time to paint a picture and get some realisation of what is happening.
2. The geth node was taking a lot of time to sync so had to find other ways to sync a node.
3. Figuring how to work around the web3js library. Prior to this I had never referrenced to documents much. 
4. Implementing the code for the first block having a smart contract transaction. After a lot of reading and debugging was able to figure it out.
