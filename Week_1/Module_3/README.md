## How to identify a smart contract block?

- A block holds records of multiple transactions mined to it. 
- To determine whether we have a smart contract in the block we need to analyze the list of transactions in it.
- If any transaction in the list of transactions does not have a to address, this means that this particular transaction is required to deploy a smart contract. 
- The first transaction of smart contract deployment is stored in block number 12841.
